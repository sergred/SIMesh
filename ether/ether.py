"""The virtual ether: one UDP endpoint that carries frames between stations.

Stations announce themselves with `hello`, describe their radio with `state`
and hand over a transmission with `tx`; the ether answers `welcome`,
`rx_begin` and `rx_end`. A frame reaches every other station that is close
enough for it to rise out of the noise and whose latest state is `RX` on the
same carrier, bandwidth, spreading factor and sync word. A station in `CAD`
on that carrier is told the frame is arriving and nothing more: it is sensing
energy, not receiving. A station that starts listening while a frame is
already on the air is told its `energy` and nothing more: it has missed the
preamble, but an instantaneous RSSI reads the frame and a CAD finds it. Two
frames sharing a
carrier and any instant of air interfere, and each receiver decides the
outcome for itself: the stronger frame survives when it leads the other by the
capture margin.

The level a frame arrives at is computed, not stated. Every station has a
position in metres and an antenna gain, every pair may have an obstruction in
dB, and

    L = P_tx + G_tx + G_rx − PL(d)
    PL(d) = FSPL(1 m, f) + 10·n·log10(d) + obstruction(tx, rx)

Positions arrive by direct call — `place()` and `obstruct()` — from whatever
is driving the run; the UDP wire to the stations never mentions them, and a
station never learns where it is.

Clocks. A station's `t` fields are its own clock and are meaningful only
relative to each other inside one message; the ether rebases every frame onto
its own monotonic clock and schedules from that, so the `t` fields it sends
back are ether microseconds. The offsets inside a frame (`t_pre - t0`,
`t_hdr - t0`, `t_end - t0`) are the transmitter's and are carried through
unchanged, which is what a receiver actually needs.

Every datagram in and out is one tab-separated line of the record:
wall-clock timestamp, direction, station id, JSON.
