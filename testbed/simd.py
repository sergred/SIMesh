"""The simulated testbed as one process: ether, stations, proxy and control.

One command starts this, and this is the whole testbed. It holds

- the `Ether` and its UDP endpoint, in this process's own event loop, so
  positions reach the medium by direct call and never over a wire;
- the stations, one firmware process on a pty each, with a supervisor apiece;
- one listener on the bind port, which routes by `Host`: a
  `<name|id>.sim.localhost` request is proxied to that station's own web UI,
  and everything else is the control page and its websockets;
- the loaded scenario, the run directory it was copied into, and whether it
  has been changed since.

The page gets one `snapshot` on connect and deltas after it; everything a
person does to the network is one message the other way. See README.md for
the protocol and INTERNALS.md for why it is shaped this way.

Nothing here blocks. Every wait is an awaitable, the stations' CLI is spoken
over asyncio streams with a timeout, and a pty is a reader on the loop.
