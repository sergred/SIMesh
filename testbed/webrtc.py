"""The WebRTC relay: one UDP port in front of every station's DataChannel.

A station speaks real WebRTC — the same ICE, DTLS and SCTP a board speaks,
from the same source. What it cannot do here is be reached: its candidate is
port 4433 on its own address, one inside the container, and the browser is
outside it with one published port to work with.

So simd stands in the middle, in the two places ICE needs it:

```
browser ──ws /webrtc──► simd ──ws /webrtc──► station      signalling, rewritten
browser ──udp──────────► simd ──udp────────► station      the DataChannel itself
```

**Signalling.** simd terminates the signalling WebSocket on both sides rather
than pumping bytes, so the SDP answer arrives as a parsed JSON message. It
rewrites the answer's connection line and host candidate to the relay's own
address, and remembers the answer's `ice-ufrag` as the name of that station's
half of the session.

**Media.** The first packet of an ICE session is a STUN binding request whose
USERNAME is `<answerer ufrag>:<offerer ufrag>` — so the ufrag learned during
signalling is what says which station a packet belongs to. After that the
browser's address is pinned to a flow and everything is forwarded both ways.

Nothing about this is visible to the station: it is answering ICE from a peer
that happens to be a relay, which is what a relay is for. And nothing about it
is visible to the browser either, which is the point — the code under test is
the shipping code, on both sides.
