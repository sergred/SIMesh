"""Setup lines, sent to a station over its TCP CLI.

A scenario configures its stations the way a person would: by typing at them.
The lines are CLI commands, so every setting the firmware has — or grows —
is reachable without this file knowing its name, and since they are settings
rather than actions, sending them again is harmless.

The channel is the station's own TCP CLI, port 8081 on its own address, which on
this target is open from boot and needs no login. It is line-oriented and
echoes nothing; what marks the end of a command's output is the prompt, a
whole line ending in `"$ "`. So an exchange is: drain to the prompt, write
one line, drain to the prompt again — and what came back in between is the
answer.

Nothing here blocks: every wait is an awaitable with a timeout, and a station
that has not finished booting simply refuses the connection, which is the
signal to try again rather than an error.
