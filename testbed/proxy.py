"""A hostname-routing HTTP reverse proxy in front of the stations.

Only published container ports are reachable from a browser outside the
container, so one port fronts every station: `Host: <label>.sim.localhost` is
routed to that station's own loopback address, `127.0.0.1<id>:80`, which keeps
each station's canonical URL space and its websockets intact. The label is the
station's name or its id, so `alpha.sim.localhost` and `1.sim.localhost` reach
the same station and a renamed node is still reachable by number.

Which labels exist is not the proxy's business: `serve()` takes a `resolve`
callable that turns one label and request path into a `(host, port)` to dial,
None for a request with nowhere to go, or a `Refusal` saying why a station
that exists will not take it. The path is there so a caller can
keep one route to itself — simd takes `/webrtc` that way, to stand in the
middle of a station's signalling. The label is None when the `Host` is not a
`.sim.localhost` name at all, which is how simd puts the control page on the
same port as the stations it fronts: one listener, and the `Host` decides
whether a request is for a station or for the map. Run alone, the proxy
resolves station numbers and nothing else.

The request head is parsed only far enough to read `Host`; after it is
forwarded the connection is a raw two-way byte pump, so keep-alive, chunked
bodies and a WebSocket upgrade all pass through untouched.
